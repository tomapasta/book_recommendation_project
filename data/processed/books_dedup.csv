„Los jest myśliwym"" (Fate is the hunter) to zbeletryzowana autobiografia amerykańskiego pilota pasażerskiego rozmiłowanego w swoim zawodzie, obejmująca trudny okres powstawanie i formowania się lotnictwa pasażerskiego, które w dwudziestoleciu międzywojennym i w czasie II wojny światowej z niezbyt pewnego i popularnego środka komunikacji przekształciło się w potęgę, jaką jest obecnie. 

Ernest Kellogg Gann urodził się w 1910 w Lincoln, w stanie Nebraska. Po ukończeniu akademii wojskowej dwa lata studiuje w Yale. Swoją lotniczą karierę trwającą siedemnaście lat zaczyna jako amator. Pod koniec lat trzydziestych zgłasza się na kurs pilotów transportowych, zorganizowany przez jedną z firm lotniczych, a następnie pracuje przez pewien czas na liniach krajowych. W 1941 roku Gann jest w pierwszej grupie lotników tworzących zalążek słynnego Air Transport Command, jedynej w swoim rodzaju formacji cywilnej na usługach wojska.",9781908059086,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/8447246-L.jpg,https://openlibrary.org/works/OL4416196W,386.0,1961.0,pol,"Air pilots, American Novelists, Biography",api
